Outbreaks
Tagline: Preempting Waterborne Disease Outbreaks with AI and Satellite Data.

Core Problem
Over 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with feces. Waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and dysentery cause hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, often in low-resource communities. Outbreaks are traditionally detected reactively--after people get sick--leading to delayed and costly responses.

Technical Solution
Outbreaks is an early-warning predictive modeling platform that shifts response from reactive to proactive.

Data Fusion Engine
Aggregates and processes multi-modal data:

Remote Sensing: NASA/USGS/ESA satellite data on sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a levels (algae bloom proxy), precipitation, and flood inundation maps.
Climate and Weather: NOAA forecasts, historical precipitation patterns, and drought indices.
Socio-economic and Infrastructure Data: Population density, access to improved water sources (JMP data), and sanitation infrastructure from local governments and NGOs.
Crowdsourced and Sentinel Data: Anonymous and aggregated mobility data to track population movement post-flooding, and local water quality reports from partner health clinics.
Predictive AI Model
An ensemble model (e.g., Gradient Boosting plus LSTMs) trained on historical outbreak data. It identifies high-risk "hotspots" by correlating environmental precursors (e.g., a heatwave followed by heavy flooding) with a high probability of pathogen contamination in water supplies.

Actionable Dashboard and Alerts
Provides a clear, GIS-based interface for public health officials at NGOs and government agencies. The system sends targeted SMS alerts to community health workers in predicted high-risk areas weeks before a potential outbreak.

Impact and Equity Focus
Saves Lives: Drastically reduces morbidity and mortality from preventable diseases.
Resource Optimization: Allows NGOs and governments to pre-position water purification tablets, medical supplies, and health teams before a crisis hits, maximizing the impact of limited aid dollars.
Closes the Data Gap: Brings advanced, space-age analytics to the most vulnerable communities who lack on-the-ground water testing resources.
MVP: Predictive Risk Scoring
This proof-of-concept trains a model on synthetic, multi-modal features and predicts a Waterborne Disease Risk Score (0-100) for a given latitude, longitude, and date.

How it Works
Generate synthetic data that mimics environmental + socio-economic drivers.
Train a tree-based regressor (XGBoost if available, else GradientBoosting).
Score new coordinates and render a Folium risk map.
Quick Start
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
Web App
python webapp.py
Open http://localhost:8001 in your browser.

API (REST)
Endpoints (base URL http://localhost:8001/api):

POST /score with JSON { "lat": 0.5, "lon": 32.5, "date": "2024-01-10" }
POST /score/batch with JSON list or file=@points.csv
GET /points?limit=1500&start=2023-01-01&end=2023-12-31
GET /export/csv
GET /export/pdf
Docker (One Command)
docker compose up --build
Then open http://localhost:8001.

GitHub Pages (Static Demo)
The docs/ folder contains a static demo suitable for GitHub Pages. It uses precomputed data in docs/data/ and does not run the live API.

Enable Pages in GitHub:

Source: main branch
Folder: /docs
Optional NASA POWER sample (requires network access):

USE_NASA_POWER=true python run.py
CLI overrides:

python run.py --use-nasa-power --power-grid-size 6 --power-bbox "-5,5,28,38"
Enable mock GEE overlays:

python run.py --use-gee-mock
Outputs are written to results/:

risk_scored_points.csv
risk_map.html
nasa_power_sample.csv (when USE_NASA_POWER=true)
nasa_power_cache.csv (cached NASA POWER response)
model_report.json
model_diagnostics_fit.png
model_diagnostics_residuals.png
Research-Grade Extras
Cross-validated model selection across linear, gradient boosting, random forest, and XGBoost (if installed).
Holdout evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, R2) plus top feature importance report.
Diagnostics: fit scatter and residual distribution plots.
Calibration layer (linear) on top of the selected model.
Prediction intervals from quantile regression models.
Time-series features (rolling precipitation, SST, flood metrics) per spatial bin.
Real-Data Connectors (Stubs)
NASA POWER API URL builder + parser in data/nasa_power.py (network fetch gated by allow_network=True).
Google Earth Engine interface placeholders in data/gee_interface.py.
Mock GEE raster sampling in data/gee_mock.py (enabled by default for chlorophyll + flood overlays).
When USE_NASA_POWER=true, daily precipitation and air temperature are merged into the synthetic training set using a small latitude/longitude grid and inverse-distance weighting.

POWER configuration lives in config/settings.py:

POWER_BBOX (grid coverage)
POWER_GRID_SIZE (points per axis)
POWER_START_DATE / POWER_END_DATE
POWER_USE_DATASET_BBOX (align the POWER grid to the synthetic dataset bbox)
